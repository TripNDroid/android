TripNDroid Mobile Engineering
===========

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with TripNDroid roms, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/download/using-repo).

To initialize your local repository using the TripNDroid trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/TripNRaVeR/android.git -b master-44

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
